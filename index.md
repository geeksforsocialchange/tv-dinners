# Welcome to Taphouse TV Dinners

{:.mb0}

**Do you live in Hulme, Manchester and want cooked meals delivered to you during the Covid-19 crisis?**

The [Old Abbey Taphouse](http://theoldabbeytaphouse.co.uk/), [Geeks for Social Change](http://gfsc.studio/), [ACORN](https://acorntheunion.org.uk/), and [Gaskell Garden Project](https://gaskellgardenproject.co.uk/) have collaborated to provide a free or pay-as-you-feel meal service for residents, suggested donation Â£2 per meal. If you can't afford this don't worry, **this service is for you**, please sign up and let us feed you through this difficult time.

We can also help with collecting groceries, provide checkin calls, help with gas and electric payment, pick up your prescriptions for you, and other services on request. We are run entirely by volunteers so may not be able to fulfil all requests.

We are currently delivering once a week on a Tuesday. Deliveries include a meal (generally meat or vegan options), some sides or starters, and donated sweet treats from local supermakets that are nearing their best before date.

## Eligibility

We welcome registrations from M15 postcodes and people slightly outside this area who have a high need for the service. We are currently piloting the scheme and slowly building to meet demand so might not be able to meet all requests straight away.

The service is open to everyone in these areas regardless of age or ability.

## Registration

To register for the service, please fill the form below. We will phone you to confirm your details and welcome you to the project.
