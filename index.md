**Do you live in Hulme, Manchester and want cooked meals delivered to you during the Covid-19 crisis?**

The [Old Abbey Taphouse](http://theoldabbeytaphouse.co.uk/), [Geeks for Social Change](http://gfsc.studio/), [ACORN](https://acorntheunion.org.uk/), and [Gaskell Garden Project](https://gaskellgardenproject.co.uk/) have collaborated to provide a free or pay-as-you-feel meal service for residents. Suggested donation is £3 per meal. If you can't afford this don't worry, **this service is for you**, please sign up and let us feed you through this difficult time.

We can also help with collecting groceries, provide checkin calls, help with gas and electric payment, pick up your prescriptions for you, and other services on request. We are run entirely by volunteers so may not be able to fulfil all requests.

## Eligibility

We are currently seeking expressions of interest from residents who live in the Aquarius and Monton Estates and Greenheys Lane, where we will initially pilot the service. We will begin a "soft launch" from Mon 20th April 2020.

We also welcome registrations from residents with M15 postcodes so we can get an idea of demand. outside this area.

The service is open to everyone in these areas regardless of age or ability.

## Health and safety information

We use a small team of volunteers who have a low chance of health complications from Covid-19. We are undertaking training on how to make food preperation as safe as possible and the use of masks and gloves. Food for each meal will be cooked by one person. Deliveries will be left outside doors with no contact made.

We intend to deliver food cold or frozen in the first instance but will aim to deliver hot food to those without the ability to reheat at home as the project develops. Information on how to reheat food will be sent out with each meal.

We will do our best to cater for all diets and allergies but please be aware we may not be able to cater for more complex needs.
