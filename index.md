# Welcome to Taphouse TV Dinners
{:.mb0}

**Do you live in Hulme, Manchester and want cooked meals delivered to you during the Covid-19 crisis?**

The [Old Abbey Taphouse](http://theoldabbeytaphouse.co.uk/), [Geeks for Social Change](http://gfsc.studio/), [ACORN](https://acorntheunion.org.uk/), and [Gaskell Garden Project](https://gaskellgardenproject.co.uk/) have collaborated to provide a free or pay-as-you-feel meal service for residents. Suggested donation is Â£3 per meal. If you can't afford this don't worry, **this service is for you**, please sign up and let us feed you through this difficult time.

We can also help with collecting groceries, provide checkin calls, help with gas and electric payment, pick up your prescriptions for you, and other services on request. We are run entirely by volunteers so may not be able to fulfil all requests.

We will begin delivering to the Aquarius and Monton Estates and Greenheys Lane from 20th April 2020. We welcome registrations from residents with M15 postcodes so we can get an idea of demand.

[To register for the service, please fill in this form](https://airtable.com/shr011U0OscveCvHl){:.f4 .grow .no-underline .br-pill .ph3 .pv3 .mv3 .mb2 .dib .white .bg-dark-pink}

_If you need support to complete this form then please call ACORN on [0754 9673865](tel:07549673865) who can fill it in for you._

We use a small team of volunteers who have a low chance of health complications from Covid-19. We are undertaking training on how to make food preperation as safe as possible and the use of masks and gloves. Food for each meal will be cooked by one person. Deliveries will be left outside doors with no contact made.

# Can you help?

We are in need of some supplies to increase our food production, set up a community radio station, and start a newsletter. If you can provide any of the below then please get in touch with the relevant person.
