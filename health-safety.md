# Health and Safety information

We use a small team of volunteers who have a low chance of health complications from Covid-19. We are undertaking training on how to make food preperation as safe as possible and the use of masks and gloves. Food for each meal will be cooked by one person. Deliveries will be left outside doors with no contact made.

We intend to deliver food cold or frozen in the first instance but will aim to deliver hot food to those without the ability to reheat at home as the project develops. Information on how to reheat food will be sent out with each meal.

We will do our best to cater for all diets and allergies but please be aware we may not be able to cater for more complex needs.
