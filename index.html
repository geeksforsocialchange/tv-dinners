<h1 class="mb0">Welcome to Taphouse TV Dinners</h1>

<p><strong>Do you live in Hulme, Manchester and want cooked meals delivered to you during the Covid-19 crisis?</strong></p>

<p>The Old Abbey Taphouse, Geeks for Social Change, Acorn, and Gaskell Garden Project have collaborated to provide a free or pay-as-you-feel meal service for residents. Suggested donation is Â£3 per meal. If you can't afford this don't worry, <strong>this service is for you</strong>, please sign up and let us feed you through this difficult time.</p>

<p>We can also help with collecting groceries, provide checkin calls, help with gas and electric payment, pick up your prescriptions for you, and other services on request. We are run entirely by volunteers so may not be able to fulfill all requests.</p>

<p class="tc"><a href="https://airtable.com/shraAVJA7YQGXv1EG" class="f4 grow no-underline br-pill ph3 pv3 mv3 mb2 dib white bg-dark-pink">To register for the service, please fill in this form</a></p>

<p>Alternatively call <a href="tel:07549673865">0754 9673865</a> and someone will do this for you.</p>

<p>We use a small team of volunteers who have a low chance of health complications from Covid-19. We are undertaking training on how to make food preperation as safe as possible and the use of masks and gloves. Food for each meal will be cooked by one person. Deliveries will be left outside doors with no contact made.</p>

<h1 class="mb0">Can you help?</h1>

<p>We are in need of some supplies to increase our food production, set up a community radio station, and start a newsletter. If you can provide any of the below then please get in touch with the relevant person.</p>
